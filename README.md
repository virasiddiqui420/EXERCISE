LAB SESSION 6 IS ALL ABOUT GITHUB 
GitHub is a web-based platform and a highly used software that is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Say for example, a software developer team wants to build a website and everyone has to update their codes simultaneously while working on the project. In this case, GitHub helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit, and manage the code files.
